/**
 * ExecutionState is being used by Dataset and DatasetSource classes of the rest model.

 * Dataset: When a Dataset is created, it will invoke Agents to prepare their data. The ExecutionState of the Dataset
 * will be EXECUTING at this point. Once all Agents prepare their data, th ExecutionState of the Dataset will be
 * READY since the user now will select/discard the data sources of the Dataset. After this selection,
 * the ExecutionState will be FINAL. If one of the DatasetSources of the Dataset receives error during dataset preparation,
 * then the ExecutionState of the dataset will be set to ERROR.
 *
 * DatasetSource: When an Agent is invoked to prepare its data, the associated DatasetSource's ExecutionState will be
 * EXECUTING. When the data is ready at the Agent, then the ExecutionState will be FINAL. Hence, DatasetSource uses only
 * two of the available ExecutionState enumeration values. If data preparation gives an error on the associated Agent of
 * the DatasetSource then the ExecutionState will be set to ERROR.
